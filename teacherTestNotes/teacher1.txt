Testing Procedure Feedback
- Student warm up started out too difficult for her (changed for other people)
- Confusion about the fact that the question text was not to be entered in teacher interface
- Hawthorne effect was probably strong 

Teacher Interface Feedback
- Display Options made sense to her (i.e. changing axis options)
- Help text (based on hovering) hard to find
- Add Criteria button seemed hard to find
- Did not understand what grade weight was
- Had a lot of trouble understand how Criteria Options would work until explained by researcher
- Appreciated and understood the green and red visualization of the Function Followed Criteria
- Python syntax was confusing. It was not obvious (box did not turn red) when they had the wrong syntax
- Derivative criteria not completely obvious.
- Scroll bar of criteria options is hidden on Mac so it's not obvious that scrolling is possible
- The words choice was difficult
- 

Bugs:
- On Mac Chrome, the drawing in Draw Testing was offset

Lessons learned:
- Make a tutorial
- Change criteria options word to rubric
