Student Interface:
- There was some errors in grading (due to incorrect choice of criteria). Oops!

Teacher Interface:
- Started clicking around pretty quickly and had a good idea of what they wanted
- When choice given for students to set axis, visualization is weird
- For Rectangular Pen, decided just to check for critical points
- Hovering for help text is hard to discover
- Did not think to try testing their own criteria
- Quickly felt comfortable with interface

Lessons Learned:
- Criteria Options should probably always show Teacher View
- Need examples
