Bugs:
- drawing is offset from mouse click when the browser is zoomed in
- When adding multiple points in teacher interface, the new point input appears in a weird place
- Derivative criterion seemed to display 

Student Interface Feedback:
- Likes that it's freeform

Teacher Interface Feedback:
- Since his own drawing passed, he assumed that his criteria was good enough, but in fact the criteria was too permissive
- Liked red/green visualization
- Seemed to understand what brackets were after a while
- Visualization of derivative made sense
- Felt comfortable after 
- Realized that scribbling in the axes might get 100% even if it's technically the wrong answer

Lessons learned:
- Draw Testing and Student View should just be one and the same
- It would still be nice to auto generate some answers
- Montonic "Trend" parameter is pretty confusing
- The meaning of "monotonic" is not familiar
