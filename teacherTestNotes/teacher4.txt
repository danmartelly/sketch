Bugs:
- Derivative criteria shows the wrong angle

Student Interface:
- Grade received could be a little cryptic
- Eraser: should know how big of an area its going to erase

Teacher Interface Feedback:
- When the axis will be set by students, it would be nice to be able to get them started on a certain min/max
- Seemed to figure out how meaning of visualization very quickly
- When selecting axes, would like to actually see selected min/max appear on axes (instead of being just off screen). Tutorial could say to add buffer, or it could be automatic
- When 0 is included on the axes, should be more obvious.
- Instead of help text on hovering, have a little question mark circle off to the right to be clicked with same text
- Decimals are not nice
- Grade weight should always be greater than 0 otherwise it gives you negative grade
- Would like to use it in class
- Would like to see it able to be used for geometry as well
- Understanding bracket visualization is a little confusing at first but can be explained
- Visually overwhelming at first but then it was fine
- Pixels may be a confusing word for teachers. Maybe use percentage instead
- Fraction filled is weird. Maybe just make it accuracy
- 

Lessons learned:
- Will need an undo button eventually
- "Rubric" better than "Criteria Options"
- Maybe change Domain word to be something
- Have a little question circle to click on it
