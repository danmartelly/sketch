Procedure Feedback:
- Confused about where they might have to place question text
- General confusion about task

Student Interface Feedback:
- Make 0 axis a different color or just stand out more
- Maybe have ability to show work
- Compared this freeform input to IXL which is more like a graphing calculator or something

Teacher Interface Feedback:
- Confusion about how system works. What effect would her choices have on anything?
- Needed to explain how criteria work (i.e. submission is passed through each criteria and grade is the average)
- Function Followed function needs to be in terms of x
- Green and red visualization seems like an inequality
- Tried to graph on student view and submit when Draw Testing is the only one that works.
- It would be nice if kids could graph an inequality
- While changing criteria, it would be nice if your drawn submission gets automatically regraded. Or at least it should be obvious that the grade is now old information
- Wording is intimidating, descriptions/explanations need to be better
  - FunctionFollowedCriteria was not obvious
  - Monotonic was particularly difficult
  - "Criteria Options" word was not clear. "Rubric" would be better
- Hovering over text box for help is difficult to use
- Felt like she could have clicked around on her own and started to make sense (Hawthorne Effect)
- Was excited about the prospect of auto grading and the freeform drawing
- Wanted to look more like graph paper
- Decimal points on axes are probably unnecessary. It's better to not have it unless you need it.
- Visualization toggle was useful


Bugs:
- Point criteria: added points appear below the "message on failure"
- Eraser is laggy

Lessons learned:
- Need error feedback about wrong variable name (use b in terms of x) in input function
- Need only one of Draw Testing or Student View (not both)
