<h3>Sunday Driver</h3>
<p>Jerry goes out for a 30 minute drive. Unfortunately, there's something wrong with his car and it can only accelerate at a constant rate of 1km/hour/minute. His brake time is not affected and is not necessarily constant.</p>

<p>This is how Jerry's drive goes</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jerry starts at rest.</li>
	<li>For the first 5 minutes, Jerry accelerates. After that his acceleration drops to 0.</li>
	<li>At minute 15, he sees a stop sign and begins applying the brakes.</li>
	<li>At minute 16, his car has stopped.</li>
	<li>At minute 17, he accelerates for the next 3 minutes.</li>
	<li>At minute 28, he's close to his destination and slowly applies his brakes until the car stops at minute 30</li>
</ol>
<p>Sketch the velocity of the car over the 30 minute period.</p>
